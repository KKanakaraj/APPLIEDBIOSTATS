# Report 1: (initial deadline 12.00 noon on 16 April)

The purpose of this assignment is to give you practice writing a scientific report. Report writing is an extremely important skill, regardless of whether you continue in an academic career, in government or in industry.

You should analyze your data in an appropriate manner (either like lab week 2 for regression or lab week 3 for anova) and write a short report, 3-5 pages (max). Please submit your report (as a .pdf file) by email. I will comment on and return reports in the order that I receive them.

Your report should contain a short background/intro to the problem (including the aim of the original study), a presentation of the results of your statistical analyses, including exploratory data analysis, model fitting and final model, along with a short discussion of any shortcomings of the final model, and your conclusions. Include relevant graphics and tables, but DO NOT include any raw R code or output (you will be penalized for this if you do). Your graphs should be 'pretty', if you copy/paste a graph from the screen, it will most likely appear to be blurry and you will be penalized for this. It is easiest to include nice-looking graphs if you use R Markdown, but this is not the only way.

Your report will also be graded based on language use and overall presentation. (It can be in either English or French.) Please use 12 point font and margins of 2.5 cm. Remember to number each page at the bottom (including page 1). Do not include a cover page, and do not exceed 5 pages or you will be penalized. Inside the top margin of each page, please include the surnames of each group member (separated by commas).

As a reminder, this report counts for 1 point (out of 6) of your course note. The initial deadline (12.00 noon on 16 April) is for your preliminary report. (The final version is due by 12.00 noon 20 June). If you turn in your report before the initial deadline then I will be able to comment on your report and you can re-do it before the final deadline.

When you email me with the names of your group members I will send you the dataset.


For each data set there is also an explanation to go along with it, including which columns contain which variables and the outcome variable. There is also a literature reference that you should be able to access from EPFL / vpn.epfl.edu. You can use that as an aid to guide you in your analyses, but you can also do additional or different analyses if you want.

Also, you can use the literature paper as a guide to how you might write your report. You should include a short intro / background, including a clear statement of the problem of interest; a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA); a description of your model fitting and selection analysis; a description of your model assessment and justification / results of that; your final chosen model written in mathematical terms; inclusion of relevant plots (they should be 'pretty'); any conclusions adressing the problem of interest. You will also be evaluated on the quality of language and the overall presentation of your report.

If you return your report before the preliminary deadline, I will be able to give you commentary on how to improve your report that you can incorporate into your final submission.
